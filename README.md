# alx-higher_level_programming
A repository for learning higher level programming languages like python, Javascript as well as Databases. I shall also do some AirBNB clone.

I was part of the 2022 cohort of alx Software Engineering scholars. A requirement for the programming is to learn about higher level programming languages like python as well as maintain the best coding standards using the required guide...in the case of python, pycode is recommended.

Among the many things taught in this course are: python's creator - Guido van Rossum (a.k.a the benevolent dictator lol), where the name python came from (Monthy python flying circus - a TV show) and the zen of python which aims to capture the readability and simplicity that form the foundation upon which python language was created.

Furthermore, much emphasis is laid on the pycodestyle which is the new standard of python style code.

Finally some quiz questions were put up to test that a student gained hands on experience of what was taught - I believe that I have organized this to ensure the names are descriptive enough to show which project that I am working on.

I did most of work on the VSCode in my personal computer and use git to commit all my work to github - this is to say that I'm into this 'git' thingy too lol
