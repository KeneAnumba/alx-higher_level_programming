Python interpreters are usually installed in this path /usr/loca/bin/python3.4  (mine is actually in /usr/bin/python3.8.7)

To invoke the python interpreter in CLI, just type 'python'

To exit the python interpreter, type 'CTRL D' for unix and 'CTRL Z' for windows

Python uses '\' as escape character in strings
   e.g print(f'obi isn\'t a big fan of Emeka who is {20+8} years old')  outputs obi isn't a big fan of Emeka who is 28 years old

If you don't want python to make '\' serve as escape character in string literals, use raw strings by adding r before the first quote
  e.g print(r'C:\Obi\Emeka\Nneka') outputs C:\Obi\Emeka\Nneka
