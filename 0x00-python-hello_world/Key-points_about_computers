#In the notes below, I am making a summary of the key points that I got from studying "Python Programming: An introduction to Computer Science, 3rd Edition" by John Zelle

                          #####DEFINITION OF A MODERN COMPUTER:######
  Modern computer can be defined as a machine that stores and manipulates information under the control of a changeable program.

** 2 key points in the definition above
   (a) Storing and manipulating information = This allows a computer to be able to perform a specific task that it was given since it can manipulate the inputs given it.
        but there are other machines like calculator and gas pumps that can manipulate information to perform a specific task they are given but cannot be considered as modern compute
   
   (b) Modern computers operate under the control of changeable programs - this quality gives modern computers their versatility. While calculators and gas pumps above can just perform a singular  task, modern computers are able to perform different tasks by just changing their underlying programs.

Hence for modern computers, programs (software) rule the physical machines (hardware). It is the software that determines what any machine does.

The process of designing and creating software is called Programming.

Program - a sequence of instructions telling a computer what to do.

      ######ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE######
Computer Science is not actually the study of computers. According to Edsger Dijkstra, computers are to computer science what telescopes are to astronomy.
Computers are not actually the objects of study in Computer Science but it is an important tool.

The fundamental question of computer science is "WHAT CAN BE COMPUTED?"

Computer scientists use numerous techniques to answer this question: Design, analysis and experimentation.
Design - creating an algorithm (step by step process) to solve a problem and achieve the desired result.
  - Failing to devise an algorithm doesn't mean the problem is not solvable 
Analysis - process of examining algorithms and problems mathematically to see whether they are solvable or not
Experimentation - comes in when analysis fails due to complexity or problems being ill-defined to lend themselves to analysis.


          ###### HARDWARE BASICS ########
CPU - brain of the computer where all the computations are done.
Memory - stores programs and data.
       CPU can only access the information stored in the main memory (RAM - Random Access Memory)
                RAM is fast and volatile - when power is turned off, information is this memory is lost.
       ROM - Read Only Memory - usually for permanent storage of information.
              Hard disk drive (HDD) - stores information as magnetic patterns on a spinning disk
              Solid state drive (SSD) - uses electronic circuits known as flash memory.

When one wants to fire up a program, first the instructions that comprise the program are copied from ROM to RAM and then the CPU starts executing the program in a
fetch-decode-execute cycle (i.e the instructions is fetched from RAM, decoded to figure out what it represents and the appropriate action is then carried out)
